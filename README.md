# calculaide
Simple calculator for explaning math topics.

# Description

The goal is simple. Math topics are understood better 
when one sees the formula along with its implementation in a programming language.

Each calculator is designed to give an explanation on the topic and the underlying
formula used in the implementation.
Explanations are mostly based on our math notes in [here](https://github.com/D-K-E/ai-notes).
Once you see the formula and the explanation try implementing it on your own.
A basic implementation is also provided whereever possible.
